    "\n",
    "The era of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy began with the detection of binary black hole (BBH) mergers, by the [Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/32/7/074001/meta;jsessionid=C8FA1A8959EC5DE7B54BED96DDBEF1CD.c4.iopscience.cld.iop.org) (LIGO) detectors, during the first of the Advanced Detector Observation Runs. Three detections, [GW150914](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102), [GW151226](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.241103), and [GW170104](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.221101), and a lower significance candidate, [LVT151012](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.6.041015), have been announced so far. The [Advanced Virgo detector](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0264-9381/32/2/024001/meta) joined the second observation run on August 1, 2017.\n",

    "### 1.1 Three-Way Detection of Gravitational Waves\n",
    "On August 14, a signal was seen at LIGO-Livingston; 8 milliseconds later, LIGO-Hanford reported a detection; and 6 milliseconds after that, Virgo detected a signal. A statistical analysis by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations suggested that such a multi-site detection would occur in random signals at most once in 27,000 years. \n",
    "**The first simultaneous detection of gravitational radiation by the LIGO and Virgo detectors greatly improves localization of the source and permits a novel test of general relativity - [GW170814: A Three-Detector Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Coalescence](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.141101#fulltext).**\n",
    "\n",
    "The LIGO and Virgo team alerted the astronomical community to the detection, but no corresponding signal has been found in any part of the electromagnetic spectrum or in neutrinos. The lack of an optical counterpart isn’t really a surprise *two such black holes in a close orbit are likely to sweep their immediate vicinity clear of gas and dust and the gravitational radiation released by the merger does not agitate what little material remains enough to emit electromagnetic energy*.

    "### 1. 2 Observations of a Binary Neutron Star Merger\n",
    "\n",
    "On August 17, 2017 astronomers around the world were alerted to gravitational waves observed by the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors. This gravitational wave event, now known as GW170817, appeared to be the result of the merger of two neutron stars (BNS). Less than two seconds after the GW170817 signal, NASA's [Fermi](https://fermi.gsfc.nasa.gov/) satellite observed a gamma-ray burst, now known as GRB170817A, and within minutes of these initial detections telescopes around the world began an extensive observing campaign. The [Swope telescope](http://obs.carnegiescience.edu/swope) in Chile was the first to report a bright optical source (SSS17a/AT2017gfo) in the galaxy NGC 4993 and several other teams independently detected the same transient over the next minutes and hours. For the next several weeks astronomers observed this location with instruments sensitive across the electromagnetic spectrum; these observations provide a comprehensive view of this cataclysmic event starting ~100 seconds before merger until several weeks after. The observations support the hypothesis that two neutron stars merged in NGC 4993 - producing gravitational waves, a short-duration gamma-ray burst, and a kilonova. This observation firmly connects kilonovae with the BNS merger, providing evidence that kilonovae result from the radioactive decay of the heavy elements formed by neutron capture during a BNS merger - including gold and platinum - solving a decades long mystery of where about half of all elements heavier than iron are produced. \n",
    "GW170817 marks a new era of multi-messenger astronomy, where the same event is observed by both gravitational waves and electromagnetic waves [The Dawn of Multi-Messenger Astrophysics: Observations of a Binary Neutron Star Merger](http://ligo.org/science/Publication-GW170817MMA/). \n",

As was the case with the first three published detections, the waves were generated by the coalescence of a pair of stellar-mass black holes. When we compare its position reconstruction in the Universe with the previous events, the sky localization of GW170814 is the narrowest. This new and exciting result was reached through a triple-coincident detection, coordinated by a body of more than 1,000 international scientists forming the LIGO and Virgo Collaboration (LVC)."

    "The event was recorded on 2017 August 14, and so christened GW170814, by the LIGO observatory sites in Hanford, Washington and Livingston, Louisiana, and the more recently operational Virgo Observatory near Pisa, Italy. The signal was emitted in the final moments of the coalescence of two black holes of 31 and 25 solar masses located about 1.8 billion light-years away. But comparing the timing of the gravitational wave detections at all three sites allowed astronomers to vastly improve the location of the signal's origin on the sky. Just above the Magellanic clouds and generally toward the constellation Eridanus, the only sky region consistent with signals in all three detectors is indicated by the yellow contour line in this all-sky map. The all-sky projection includes the arc of our Milky Way Galaxy. An improved three-detector location of the gravitational wave source allowed rapid follow-up observations by other, more conventional, electromagnetic wave observatories that can search for potentially related signals. The addition of the Virgo detector also allowed the gravitational wave polarization to be measured, a property that further confirms predictions of Einstein's general relativity. "

    "\n",
    "GWsky is an easy-to-use, interactive Python script to effectively tile the sky localization of a gravitational-wave event providing accurate telescope pointings. The Field-of-View footprints for each electromagnetic or neutrino observatory are displayed in real time in the Aladin Sky Atlas software using a dedicated interoperability application. Each Field of View is accompanied by descriptive statistics to manage the sequence of pointings. The ability to manage interactively and quickly a set of strategies – when a GW sky localization is issued – may be especially useful for a large class of space/ground-based telescopes to formulate requests of target-of-opportunity observations.\n",
